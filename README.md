<h1>Mårup Theme</h1>

<p>The goal for this project was to set up a workflow with Gulp JS and underscore's Wordpress Starter Theme.
For the gulp part I used Ahmadawais WPGulp (https://github.com/ahmadawais/WPGulp)</p>

<p>Underscore WP Starter Theme ––> https://underscores.me/</p>

<p>Wordpress CLI ––> https://wp-cli.org/de/</p>

Adjusted the file structure to work with WPGulps file structure.

Implemented the WP Bootstrap NavWalker class ––> https://github.com/wp-bootstrap/wp-bootstrap-navwalker

Project stopped due to personal reasons. Maybe I'll continue this project later on.
